EmailScheduler for Joomla
=========================
Homepage: https://www.yireo.com/software/joomla-extensions/emailscheduler

The EmailScheduler component offers an API for emails to be sent with a delay. The component allows 
for third party extensions to store these emails into the table of EmailScheduler, together with a specified
delay. Next, the EmailScheduler component (via a cronjob) picks up upon these scheduled mails and sends
them when the time is right.

For details on using the API, see our API documentation:
